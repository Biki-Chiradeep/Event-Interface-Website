    { title: "Why Artificial?", dsc: "The term Artificial in AI emphasizes that these intelligent systems are created by humans, using artificial means, such as algorithms, computer programs, and data. This distinction highlights the difference between natural intelligence (human intelligence) and artificial intelligence (machine intelligence). Examples of artificial systems:•	Machines: Devices like computers, mobiles or robots that perform tasks.•	Software:  Algorithms or Step-by-step procedures or rules designed to solve problems or perform computations.•	Data: Information stored digitally in storage devices in the form of 0s and 1s,", audio: "voice/IntroVoice8.mp3" },
    { title: "How Artificial Intelligence is created?", dsc: "AI's are mainly a software or a code, made by combining the Data, Mathematical Algorithm or logics which mimics the human intelligence and with the computational capabilities of machines.   Together, this combinations allows AI systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as analyzing data, and solve complex problems. However, to truly understand how AI functions, we first need to understand the foundation it is built upon—software. To dive deeper into AI, we must first explore the core aspects of software:•	What is software?•	How does it work?•	What are the components of software?•	How does software become AI software?", audio: "voice/IntroVoice9.mp3" },
    { title: "1. What is Software?", dsc: "Software is a set of instructions, programs, or data that tell a computer what to do. Unlike hardware, which is the physical parts that we can touch, software operates digitally and tells the hardware how to work.1.	Physical hardware components like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive, pen drive, SD cards, monitor, Key pad, mouse.2.	Application software (e.g., web browsers, games, or mobile apps) and system software (e.g., operating systems like Windows or Linux, Android) and application software (e.g., web browsers, games, or mobile apps, calculator, paintings, ).", audio: "voice/IntroVoice10.mp3" },
    { title: "2. How Does Software Work?", dsc: "•	Software works by following a set of instructions (code) written in programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.•	These instructions are processed by the computer's hardware, such as the CPU, memory, and storage.•	The process involves:1.	Input: Receiving data or commands from the user. (e.g., Pressing the like button on some selfie photo.)2.	Processing: Executing the instructions to perform calculations, manipulate data, or make decisions.(Understand the user want to Like that selfie photo)3.	Output: Delivering the results to the user or another system (e.g., It reflects that you like the picture along with your user name and increases the like count on the post.)", audio: "voice/IntroVoice11.mp3" },
    { title: "3. What Are the Components of Software?", dsc: "Software is made up of several key components that allow it to function effectively:•	User Interface (UI) for Input: The visual and interactive elements through which users interact with the software (monitor, touch-screen of a mobile, microphone, keyboard, mouse, etc.).•	Data: Stores the information (like a photo) that you input through the UI in the form of data, which is stored in some storage devices, like hard disks, pen drives, SD cards, etc.•	Code or Software: Step-by-step instructions for solving problems or performing tasks. These steps are written as mathematical algorithms or logics in some programming language that a computer can understand. These are called the software. (Code or software are also stored in some storage devices.)•	CPU: Now the processing happens in the Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU uses the stored data from storage devices and follows the step-by-step instructions (software) to generate the output. (This is called processing or computing.)•	User Interface (UI) for Output: The visual and interactive elements through which the software interacts with the user. (Monitor, display of a mobile, speakers, etc.).", audio: "voice/IntroVoice12.mp3" },
    { title: "4. How Does Software Become AI Software?", dsc: "4. How Does Software Become AI Software?For software to become AI software, it must integrate certain additional components and processes:•	Automation: AI software is designed to automate tasks that usually require human intelligence, like analyzing data, recognizing patterns, and making decisions based on inputs.•	Machine Learning Algorithms: Unlike traditional software that follows fixed instructions, AI software uses algorithms to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.•	Data Input: AI software requires large datasets to learn and improve its performance. These datasets are the foundation for training machine learning models.•	Training and Testing: The software must be trained on datasets to improve its accuracy and performance, and then tested to ensure it works as intended.•	AI Models: Pre-trained or custom models, such as neural networks, are used to perform tasks like language processing, image recognition, or decision-making.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice13.mp3" },
    { title: "Learn How an AI Model Works on the Internet  Step by Step", dsc: "Today’s AI models are mostly using the Internet for their operation. So we need to learn the overview of how AI software or any software is deployed on the Internet so that we can access those software. We will first learn how some popular software is working right now, like:•	Google (Search): Finds and organizes vast information across the web.•	YouTube: Streams videos to billions of users daily.•	Facebook, WhatsApp (Social Media): Connect people and allow real-time sharing of posts, photos, and chats.•	Zomato, Swiggy (Online Food Delivery): Help users order food online by connecting them to restaurants.•	Ola, Uber (Online Car Rental): Provide transportation services by connecting riders and drivers.•	Zerodha, Groww (Online Trading Platform): Allow people to trade stocks and mutual funds online.•	Paytm, Google Pay (Online Payment Applications): Enable secure digital transactions for various purposes.•	Gmail, Yahoo Mail (Email): Offer fast, reliable email services.•	Amazon, Flipkart, Zepto, Blinkit (E-commerce): Let users shop online and get products delivered to their homes.•	ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek (AI Software): Demonstrate how artificial intelligence can help in conversations, information search, and more.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice14.mp3" },
    { title: "How Software Works on the Internet", dsc: "Every software, to run, needs a computer or a device with the same functionality that a computer has: 1.	CPU: To process tasks and perform operations.2.	Storage Device: To save the software files and data.3.	Internet Connection: To make it accessible online and communicate with users.Similarly, current large software has the same requirements, but on a larger scale. In technical terms, they use:•	1. Server for CPU: For example, Google’s search engine requires thousands of servers to process billions of queries every day.•	2. Large Data Warehouse or Data Center for Storage Devices: Facebook stores billions of photos, videos, and posts in its data centers.•	3. High-Speed Internet: Apps like WhatsApp or Uber require fast Internet to provide real-time communication or driver-location updates.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice15.mp3" },
    { title: "How Software is Deployed on the Internet", dsc: "Let’s break it into steps to understand how software is made available online:1.	Development: Every software is first created and tested on computers during the development phase. For instance, Zomato's team creates the app features and tests them internally.2.	Hosting on Servers: After testing, the software is uploaded to servers. Servers are powerful computers that handle requests from users. Popular hosting services include AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.3.	Storage Setup: Data storage systems (like large data warehouses) are connected to store user data. For example, Uber stores user trip history and payment details securely in its data centers.4.	Domain Name and Accessibility: A domain name (like google.com or amazon.in) is assigned so that users can access the software via the Internet.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice16.mp3" },
    { title: "AI-Specific Deployment", dsc: "AI software, like ChatGPT or DeepSeek, follows the same process but requires additional steps:•	Specialized Hardware: For example, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) are used to process AI tasks like training models and generating responses.•	Model Hosting: Once an AI model is trained, it is hosted on servers optimized for handling AI-related tasks. For instance, ChatGPT processes user queries and generates responses instantly using such servers.•	Real-Time Data Processing: AI software often requires real-time data processing. For example, Google Pay uses AI to detect fraudulent transactions while maintaining transaction speed.In conclusion, whether it’s AI software like ChatGPT, social media like Facebook, or food delivery apps like Swiggy, all software depends on servers, data centers, and high-speed Internet to operate. The only difference is the scale and complexity of these components.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice17.mp3" },
    { title: "From Learning to Coding: How to Code a Real AI Software in Practice", dsc: "We have already learned the overview of how software works, how it is deployed on the Internet to make it accessible, and what makes a software an AI software.Now, it’s time to learn how to code a real AI software in practice. As we know, the main difference between simple software and AI software is the level of complexity. To make the learning process easier, we will start by coding simple software, ignoring complexity, just to understand the basic steps involved. Later, we will gradually move to coding AI software.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice18.mp3" },
    { title: "How Machines Understand Instructions", dsc: "Machines only understand machine language, which uses binary code:•	‘1’ for On State•	‘0’ for Off StateWe can actually code software using only 1 and 0. Some of the early software for computers was created entirely with this type of binary code. Examples of early computers include: •	ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer): Used manual switches to input binary code.•	Colossus: One of the first programmable computers, used to decrypt codes during World War II.As technology advanced, the following developments replaced manual coding:1.	Vacuum Tubes: Replaced manual switches and allowed faster processing.2.	Semiconductor Transistors: Replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller and more efficient.3.	Field Effect Transistors (FET): Enabled billions of transistors to fit onto a single silicon chip, which we now call a Processor (CPU).Even though machines still only understand On-Off states (1s and 0s), we don’t need to code directly in binary anymore. As coding complex tasks using On and Off switches is not practical.(Today, such binary-level coding is primarily used by engineers who design and build processors, where they program intricate logic gates and circuits that enable modern CPUs to function efficiently.)", audio: "voice/IntroVoice19.mp3" },
    { title: "Writing Code in Human Language", dsc: "Imagine if we could write software in natural languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, French, Urdu, or German. What if another software could convert these instructions into machine language?Today, software development achieves this with tools and processes that simplify writing instructions for machines. The process involves the following:•	Text Editor Software: We use this to write the steps or instructions in English, with some limitations or predefined rules. These predefined rules create a structured way to write code, which eventually led to what we now call coding languages or programming languages  (e.g., Python, C++, Java).•	Compiler: The compiler translates these instructions from the structured language (human-readable) into machine language (binary: 0s and 1s).•	CPU: The CPU processes the machine language to execute the instructions, complete tasks, or solve problems.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice20.mp3" },
    { title: "The Limitations of Current Coding", dsc: "Even though tools and coding languages have made programming easier, they still have limitations:•	Technology is not yet smart enough to fully understand human languages as we use them in everyday communication.•	There are specific rules and syntax we need to follow to write code, which can make the process challenging for beginners.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice21.mp3" },
    { title: "Role of AI in Coding", dsc: "This is where AI comes into play. AI aims to remove the complexity involved in coding by making the process more natural.For example, imagine an AI tool that can understand your spoken or written instructions in English and automatically translate them into a working program. AI is already simplifying coding through tools like:•	GitHub Copilot: Assists developers by suggesting code snippets and automating repetitive tasks.•	AutoML: Allows users to create machine learning models without deep coding knowledge.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice22.mp3" },
    { title: "The Key Difference Between Simple Software and Artificial Software", dsc: "•	Simple Software: Follows pre-defined instructions written using coding languages or programming languages  by a human programmer.•	Artificial Software (AI Software): Goes beyond pre-defined instructions. It can:o	Understand human language.o	Solve complex problems.o	Learn and improve through study or experience, just like humans.Modern Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek Grock AI, Meta AI are examples of AI software capable of performing tasks that require understanding and generating human-like text.", audio: "voice/IntroVoice23.mp3" },
